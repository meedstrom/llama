;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements the macro `##', which provides compact
;; syntax for short `lambda', without actually being new syntax,
;; which would be difficult to get merged into Emacs.  Past attempts
;; to add syntax were met with determined pushback and the use of a
;; macro was suggested as an alternative.

;; The `##' macro, whose signature is (## FN &rest BODY), expands
;; to a `lambda' expression, which wraps around these arguments.

;; This `lambda' expression calls the function FN with arguments
;; BODY and returns its value.  Its own arguments are derived from
;; symbols found in ARGS.

;; Each symbol from `%1' through `%9', which appears in BODY,
;; specifies an argument.  Each symbol from `&1' through `&9', which
;; appears in BODY, specifies an optional argument.  All arguments
;; following an optional argument have to be optional as well, thus
;; their names have to begin with `&'.  Symbol `&*' specifies extra
;; (`&rest') arguments.

;; Instead of `%1', the shorthand `%' can be used; but that should
;; only be done if it is the only argument, and using both `%1' and
;; `%' is not allowed.  Likewise `&' can be substituted for `&1'.
;; Both shorthands cannot be used in function position.

;; Instead of:
;;
;;   (lambda (a _ &optional c &rest d)
;;     (foo a (bar c) d))
;;
;; you can use this macro and write:
;;
;;   (##foo %1 (bar &3) &*)
;;
;; which expands to:
;;
;;   (lambda (%1 &optional _&2 &3 &rest &*)
;;     (foo %1 (bar &3) &*))

;; Unused trailing arguments and mandatory unused arguments at the
;; border between mandatory and optional arguments are also supported:
;;
;;   (##list %1 _%3 &5 _&6)
;;
;; becomes:
;;
;;   (lambda (%1 _%2 _%3 &optional _&4 &5 _&6)
;;     (list %1 &5))
;;
;; Note how `_%3' and `_&6' are removed from the body, because their
;; names begin with an underscore.  Also note that `_&4' is optional,
;; unlike the explicitly specified `_%3'.

;; The name `##' was chosen because that allows (optionally)
;; omitting the whitespace between it and the following symbol.
;; It also looks similar to #'function.

(defmacro llama (fn &rest body)
  "Expand to a `lambda' expression that wraps around FN and BODY.

This `lambda' expression calls the function FN with arguments
BODY and returns its value.  Its own arguments are derived from
symbols found in BODY.

Each symbol from `%1' through `%9', which appears in BODY,
specifies an argument.  Each symbol from `&1' through `&9', which
appears in BODY, specifies an optional argument.  All arguments
following an optional argument have to be optional as well, thus
their names have to begin with `&'.  Symbol `&*' specifies extra
\(`&rest') arguments.

Instead of `%1', the shorthand `%' can be used; but that should
only be done if it is the only argument, and using both `%1' and
`%' is not allowed.  Likewise `&' can be substituted for `&1'.

Instead of:

  (lambda (a _ &optional c &rest d)
    (foo a (bar c) d))

you can use this macro and write:

  (##foo %1 (bar &3) &*)

which expands to:

  (lambda (%1 &optional _&2 &3 &rest &*)
    (foo %1 (bar &3) &*))

Unused trailing arguments and mandatory unused arguments at the
border between mandatory and optional arguments are also supported:

  (##list %1 _%3 &5 _&6)

becomes:

  (lambda (%1 _%2 _%3 &optional _&4 &5 _&6)
    (list %1 &5))

Note how `_%3' and `_&6' are removed from the body, because their
names begin with an underscore.  Also note that `_&4' is optional,
unlike the explicitly specified `_%3'.

The name `##' was chosen because that allows (optionally) omitting
the whitespace between it and the following symbol.  If you dislike
this trickery, you can alternatively use this macro under the name
`llama'."
